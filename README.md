# CRUD-Python
First time creating a CRUD program. 
I chose Python as it was the first language that I finished courses on. 
After struggling on where to get started, I ported over some Apple code and build a fully functional website. 
Realizing I was causing too much work for myself, I started over with more sources of information and got all of my Command Prompt/Power Shell commands to function as I was hoping they would. 
I now have a functional CRUD, which must have unique names for each of the "books" entered to the database.
When I added error handling to provide an error code if the user enters a duplicate book, it didn't seem to work. Looks like my code breaks as if the error handling was not there.
